ppx_seq
-------

simple unintrusive ppx rewriter that provides easy-to-construct sequence syntax

this rewriter aims to facilitate the use of Seq module, especially after the
excellent additions to it starting from OCaml 4.14


install:

the package is provided in opam.ocaml.org, just issue the following

  $ opam install ppx_seq

you can also build it locally with dune

  $ dune build
  $ dune install

if you want to work on a dev version, you can use `opam pin` on this repository


usage:

play around with the rewriter in your favourite toplevel like so

  # without project, in shell
  $ ocaml $(ocamlfind printppx ppx_seq) [options...]

  # or
  $ ocaml -ppx 'ocamlfind ppx_seq/ppx.exe -as-ppx' [options...]

  (* or, in a toplevel and with ocamlfind *)
  # #require "ppx_seq"

  (* within a project that depends on ppx_seq *)
  # #use_output "dune top"

compile executables with the rewriter as a preprocessor like so

  # a shortcut is provided when compiling, not invoking a toplevel
  $ ocamlfind (c|opt) -package ppx_seq [options...]

  # ocamlfind is only used for convenience, so you can use ppx directly.. e.g.
  $ ocaml[c|opt] -ppx '..../lib/ppx_seq/ppx.exe -as-ppx' [options...]

  ;; or in a dune file
  (executable/library/test...
   ...
   (preprocess (pps ppx_seq)))
