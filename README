ppx_seq
-------

simple unintrusive ppx rewriter that provides easy-to-construct sequence syntax

this rewriter aims to facilitate the use of Seq module, especially after the
excellent additions to it starting from OCaml 4.14


usage:

seq literals which can be used in any expression

  [%seq 1; 2; 3] => - : int Seq.t = <fun>
  [%seq.empty] => - : 'a Seq.t = <fun>

play around with the rewriter in your favourite toplevel like so

  $ ocaml $(ocamlfind printppx ppx_seq) [options...] # without project
  # #use_output "dune top" # within a project that depends on ppx_seq

ocamlfind is only used for convenience, so you can use ppx directly.. e.g.
  -ppx '/usr/lib/ppx_seq/ppx.exe -as-ppx'
without depending on ocamlfind.

and of course, you can depend on it as a rewriter by adding the following to
your dune file
  (executable/library/test...
   ...
   (preprocess (pps ppx_seq)))
..or using ocamlfind, or directly, as both explained above
