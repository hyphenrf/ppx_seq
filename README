ppx_seq
-------

simple unintrusive ppx rewriter that provides easy-to-construct sequence syntax

this rewriter aims to facilitate the use of Seq module, especially after the
excellent additions to it starting from OCaml 4.14

example:
  [%seq 1; 2; 3] => fun()->Cons(1, fun()->Cons(2, fun()->Cons(3, fun()->Nil)))
  [%seq.empty] => fun()->Nil
